# Book Report Viewer with Raylib

## Description

This project was developed to learn about Raylib and to create a graphical user interface (GUI) using the library. Written in Python, the application reads a text file (such as a book), analyzes its content, and generates a report that counts the total number of words and the frequency of each letter in the text. The user can scroll through the results in an interactive window with a clean and dynamic interface.

The goal of this project was to understand how to work with Raylib for building graphical applications and to implement text analysis functions in Python for real-world use cases. The result is a simple yet engaging program that showcases both technical and creative aspects of programming.

## Features

- Text analysis: Counts the total number of words and the frequency of each letter.
- Interactive GUI: Scroll through the results in a clean and dynamic interface built using Raylib.
- Python-based: A simple Python application with a focus on both GUI development and text processing.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the Raylib library installed. You can install Raylib using pip:

```bash
pip install pyray
